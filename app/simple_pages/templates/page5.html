                        by saying, "A namespace is a collection of currently defined symbolic names along with
                        information about the object that each name references. You can think of a namespace as a
                        dictionary in which the keys are the object names and the values are the objects themselves.
                        Each key-value pair maps a name to its corresponding object."

                                    whenever it is running [ex: max(), len(), int(), str()]

                                <li><u>Global</u> - contains any names defined at the level of the main program. These
                                    are created when the program starts and they remain in existence until interpreter
                                    is terminated
                                </li>
                                <li><u>Enclosing</u> - functions can can also define other functions inside themselves.
                                    Enclosing namespaces define a function to a local namespace within themselves. When
                                    the enclosing namespace is called, the local namespaces will be activated in
                                    whatever way they are programmed

                                    namespaces that live inside of an enclosed namespace are called the local namespace.
                                    They are called when their enclosing namespace is called
                                </li>

                        </li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Different namespaces can have different instances of the same name active, i.e.

                <p>
                    Testing in software development is incredibly important. <a
                        href="https://theqalead.com/topics/what-are-automation-testing-tools/">The QA Lead</a> states,
                    "Test automation is the process of testing various parts of new software with little to no human
                    involvement. Essentially, it makes sure every aspect of a software design works without a human
                    sitting in front of a computer devoting hours to manual tests."
                </p>
                <p>
                    It does not take an experienced mind to be able to understand that proper testing will allow for
                    code to be developed more efficiently, accurately, and with less errors to the overall project. <u>Automated
                    Testing</u>
                    makes this even more true, because it removes the need to have humans sitting for hours on end
                    conducting
                    manual tests. Benefits of Automation Testing include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ability to easily scan multilingual sites</li>
                    <li>Able to handle test cases that are repeated throughout an application</li>
                    <li>Able to easily parse through cases that would be very tedious for manual testing</li>
                    <li>Cases that are more broad or expansive can be easily automated</li>
                    <li>Speed, consistency, cost savings, faster times to market</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                    additionally elaborates on testing that, "A test is a procedure that exercises a behavior to
                    determine if the behavior functions correctly."
                    Testing is important because it provides empirical feedback during and for development of code. <b>AAA
                    Testing</b> is a pattern for
                    structuring test cases that will generally allow for the best process and feedback. It stands for
                    <b>Arrange</b> - <b>Act</b> - <b>Assert</b>.

                <p>
                    Alluded to above, in the Glossary section, there are 4 Principles of Object Oriented Programming:
                    <b>Encapsulation</b>, <b>Inheritance</b>, <b>Polymorphism</b>, and <b>Abstraction</b>. They are
                    defined
                    with
                    examples above, but the breakdowns and examples from the application itself are repeated here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b><span class="orangered">Encapsulation</span></b> is "the idea of wrapping data and the methods
                    that
                    work on data within one unit.
                    This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental
                    modification of data.", according to <a
                        href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encapsulation-in-python/">GeeksforGeeks</a>.
                    A class in Python is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data for its member
                    functions, variables, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is an example of how this principle is implemented in my web application:

                    <b><span class="orangered">Inheritance</span></b> is the capability of one class to derive or
                    inherit
                    properties from
                    another class, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-python/">GeeksforGeeks</a>
                    writes.
                    This allows for the re-usability of code so that functions and classes don't have to be re-written
                    in
                    many places. It is also
                    transitive in nature, meaning that all children classes will inherit all the methods of their
                    parents,
                    and whatever parents their parents have - all the way in the chain
                    as long as it has been defined properly.

                    considered to be a blueprint for other classes. It allows for the creation of a set of methods that
                    must
                    be created within
                    any child classes built from the abstract class.

                    Furthermore, <a
                        href="https://www.askpython.com/python/oops/abstraction-in-python">askpython.com</a> details
                    that
                    Abstraction is used to hide internal details and display the necessary functionalities - meaning
                    displaying content in such a matter that only the essential functions get displayed to the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is an example of how this principle is implemented in my web application. You can see that the
                    "calculator.operations"
                    classes are being imported for use by classes in this file. The "Addition():" class within this file
                    then calls
                    for "Add.add()" having abstracted that method from another file.

                    states
                    that polymorphism gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there’s no confusion with
                    mixing types.
                    But each child class keeps its own methods as they are.

                <p>
                    In the example below, Polymorphism can be seen via the methods "get_result(self)" That method
                    is available for both "Addition" and "Multiplication", but if called the return output will be
                    correct for whatever one specific child called the method. They are both inheriting from their
                    parent
                    class "(Calculation)" and then altering the output as needed for their class.

                <p>
                    In the glossary above I detailed a brief overview of the SOLID principles of OOP as well as Design
                    Patterns in OOP.
                    Repeated here again, the SOLID acronym is:

                    <ul>
                        <li>a class should do one thing and do it well; should only have a single
                            reason to change. The example below shows how the class "Addition:" only handles that one
                            operation. Not subtraction, multiplication, or division as well
                        </li>

                        <li class="mb-2">objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for
                            modifications; a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.
                            <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/solid-principles">Baeldung</a> also states that in
                            following this principle, we stop
                            ourselves from modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs

                        <li>
                            In the example below you can see this being implemented with the
                            "Multiplication(Calculation):" class.
                            This class can inherit and use all the methods attributes it needs to from its parent, while
                            only modifying content in itself. The parent will remain as is regardless.

                        <li class="mb-2">every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base
                            or parent class; This means that, given that "class B" is a subclass of "class A",
                            we
                            should be able to pass an object of class B to any method that expects an object of
                            class A and the method should not give any weird output in that case

                            The child class extends the behavior of its parent, but never narrows it down.
                            An example of this principle being followed is below: where both of these Child Classes are
                            pulling from the parent "Calculation" and each have their own "get_result():" methods, which
                            operate
                            in similarly expected ways without interfering with each other or the parent.

                            By doing so, we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the

                <p>
                    According to <a
                        href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns">Refactoring Guru</a>, Design Patterns in OOP
                    are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern can work like a
                    blueprint that you can customize to solve a specific issue in code. Although not a literal block of
                    code that can be copied/pasted, they are
                    general concepts for solving particular problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this web application we utilize one design pattern called <b>The Factory Method</b>. This is a
                    creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but
                    allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. An example of this is seen
                    to the right. The "def create" is the factory method.
